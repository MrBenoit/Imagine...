Discord Theme for BetterDiscord. 

Hello!
Maybe you noticed that the source code was borrowed from such a popular topic as "ClearVision". 
But I wanted to redo it for myself and in the end it turned out incredibly beautiful, as for me.
I haven't finished it to perfection yet, but I want to publish it as my first work
